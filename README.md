# _Event feedback from participants_

```
A very welcoming environment
Great topics and speakers, got to learn about bleeding edge tech used by IBM.
It included more of working on the problem than just presentation.
Informative, Interactive, Interesting topics.
Live demo, organized powerpoint. Workshop content and resources.
The hands-on experience in the data modeling workshop was very helpful! I loved being able to actually see and control how the REST API works in a web app.
Try out the image segmentation model, Analysis pipeline and demo of use cases.
Gave us experience to explore AI technologies, give an idea about data science.
Participation, Energy and ofcourse the topics!
Useful opportunities and links provided during the workshop, meeting other women in tech like myself, the food was great.
I enjoyed the female faces, the food, and all the information and resources provided.
The lectures are insightful. Follows the trend.
